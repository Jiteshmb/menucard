    <div class="p">
        There are different versions and types of Biryani around like Bombay Biryani, Hyderabadi Biryani , Dehli Biryani and list can go on. This Biryani recipe is Sindhi style which is hot and spicy. Personally this is my favourite version of biryani. The best thing about Biryani is that its a
         feast in itself and there is no need for anything elaborate to go along. And it makes for the best left overs !!

        Slow-cooked onions add moisture and flavor to these lean beef burgers. A quick blend of mayonnaise, ketchup, relish and vinegar makes a perfect tangy, sweet and creamy “special sauce” for this burger. We love the dill relish here, but use sweet relish if you prefer it. Serve with sweet potato fries.
